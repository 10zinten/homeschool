Adding all of your student's coursework
in your school schedule
can be time consuming.
We want to give you some shortcuts
to make common task creation actions easy.

<!--more-->

School Desk now includes options and improvements
that should be a boon
for school year planning.

First,
the bulk task creation page is now very smooth.
As you add tasks
on the page,
new empty entries will be appended
to the bottom
of the page.
You can add as many tasks
as you want in a single creation step.
This should be a great addition
for power users
or anyone in love with the Tab key.

Next,
you can now create many tasks
that share the same name
at one time.
For example,
if your student is in a "üéπ Piano" course
and you want to tasks to practice,
you create one task
with a "Practice" description,
then select the replicate option
with the number of times you want
to repeat the task.

Finally,
School Desk can automatically number your replicated tasks
so that each task is uniquely identified.
Spruce up your "Lesson" tasks
with automatic numbering
to create "Lesson 1," "Lesson 2,"
and all the rest.

I hope these three additions help you build your next school year quickly!
Thanks to Amanda for the excellent suggestions.
