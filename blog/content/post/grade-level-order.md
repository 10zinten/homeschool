Maybe you want to change the ordering
of the grade levels
in your school year.
Well, now you can!

This is a very brief feature update.

If you create your school year's grade levels
in an order
that you don't like,
you can now adjust the order to your liking,
just like you can with course ordering.
You can find the ordering controls
on the school year's edit page.

On an unrelated note,
I fixed some horizontal scrollbar issues.
Previously,
scroll bars would appear even when your content
(like a task description)
fit into the user interface easily.
With this change,
a variety of pages should clean up nicely
as they were intended to be seen.

Thanks to Amie for the grade level ordering feature suggestion.
