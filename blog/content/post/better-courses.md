When using School Desk,
you may have noticed
a page for a course
and another page
to show your student's progress
in the course.
These pages were, well... confusing.
In use,
finding your student's progress page was needlessly hard
and the two pages overlapped
in many ways.
Now, the course page and the student's progress page are combined
into a single page!

<!--more-->

The combined course page replaces both
of the previous versions.
From this new page,
you can:

* Set and view grades for graded work
* Set completion dates for tasks outside of the daily and weekly scheduling tools
* See multiple students simultaneously
  when a course is shared
  with multiple grade levels
* View the projected completion dates for all tasks
  (including different dates if your students progress at different rates)
* Show and hide completed tasks
  so you can stay focused
  on what is left for the year

I hope that this new course page will provide all the details you need
to work with a course
and manage your students.
