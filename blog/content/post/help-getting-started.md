If you're a new School Desk user,
I want your first experience
to be a great one!
Once you sign up
with School Desk,
the app will guide you
and introduce you
to the important types
of data
that you'll need
to be successful with planning
with School Desk.

*Why do this?*
I'm certain
that most users will have no trouble
with School Desk,
but even a great tool
can benefit you
by providing helpful context.

Online homeschool planners are different
from each other.
I know
because I took the time
to study what's available.
Maybe the last planner you used had different terms
to describe similar ideas.
Maybe the planner was radically different
from School Desk's flow.

Alternatively,
you may be new
to online homeschool planners.
If that's you,
I want to help you get your bearings
as fast as possible
and make your planning experience be a joy to do.

Like the start to a good book,
an online service should have an introduction
to get you comfortable and familiar
with what's happening.
That's why I created a flow
that will create your first critical elements
like your school year, a grade level, and a course
to introduce you
to the way School Desk runs.

If you sign up
for School Desk,
I hope you feel right at home.
If that doesn't happen,
I'd love to hear
from you and see how we can make starting out even easier.
