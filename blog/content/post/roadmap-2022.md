Happy New Year
from us at School Desk!
I'm very thankful
for all the customers
that helped School Desk grow
from a seedling idea
to useful service
in 2021.

I'd like to share with you
what I see happening
in the upcoming year.
School Desk is maturing continuously,
and I want to describe some
of the "big rocks"
that are coming up.

<!--more-->

My family runs our homeschool on the calendar year,
so my wife just finished off the school year
for our kids
before we left to visit our family
during the Christmas break.
With the school year over,
we need some kind of historical record
that we can use to prove
to our local government
that we're educating our children.

The reports section has most of the data
that is needed,
but there is a lot of clicking around
and printing
to get the required data.
This year,
I plan to add a year end report bundle.
**This bundle will package all
of the details about your school year
and the activities
for each of your students
into a single zip file
containing PDF reports.**
With this bundle,
you'll get a full snapshot
of the school year
that you can use as evidence
for whatever local government requirements
(or personal archiving goals)
that you have.

What happens when your kids have a field trip?
School Desk's break system can achieve a lot
of what is needed,
but it would be nice to be able to tie those breaks
to specific courses
or highlight them as a different type
of activity.
One of my goals this year is to **build a simple
and intuitive workflow
for handling field trips.**
My hope is that the fields trips will allow you
to better represent more
of the realities
that happen in a school year.

Aside from features,
I'm committed to **improving the user experience
and level of polish
that people expect from modern websites.**
On the boring level,
this means I will continue
to update all the software under the hood
(like open source software)
to keep the site safe, secure, and fast.
I'll also continue
to improve the ease of use
and sanding down any rough edges
in the workflows.

How can you help School Desk if you're interested?

First,
your continued feedback improves School Desk week by week.
As a software developer and not an educator,
I depend on your insight
to make School Desk a more useful tool
for homeschool educators.

Secondly,
word of mouth is the best way to help others learn
about School Desk
and give them a chance
to have easier homeschool scheduling too.
While I'm not afraid to jump into a homeschool forum
to share what I know
and point people to School Desk on occasion,
being a professional software developer doesn't put me
on much common ground
with other homeschool educators.
Your recommendation to others really help the site grow
into something more sustainable.

Finally,
if you like School Desk and would be willing to share,
I would love to have other voices
on the homepage
that can encourage others to give School Desk a try.
If you're able to share a quote
that can go on that page,
I'd love to hear from you.

I'm hoping that School Desk will be the best homeschool planning software
in 2022.
Thank you for your help
and continued support.
Here's to another year
of easier homeschool scheduling!
