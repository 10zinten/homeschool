Our new feature is the ability
to show you the newest features!
How meta!

To keep everyone apprised
of updates
to School Desk,
the app includes a "What's New?" notification badge
that will bring you
to the latest and greatest news
on this blog.

I'll announce big changes
to School Desk
that are noteworthy
to users.
Don't expect me to spam you
with trivial updates.
I suspect you don't have time to read about trivialities
and, truthfully,
I don't have time to write about them.

After clicking "What's New?,"
the notification will disappear
from the user interface
until I have something else worth sharing
with you.

If you really don't like being notified
about app changes,
that's no problem!
You can toggle off the notifications feature
on the "Settings" page.

I hope that this method
of communicating will delight you
with new little gifts
from School Desk
as you use it. 🎁
