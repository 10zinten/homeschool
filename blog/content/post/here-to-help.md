Where do you go
when you want to learn more about School Desk?
Now,
we have an answer.
The [School Desk documentation](/docs/) is your destination
for learning about the app.

I want the app to be so simple
that you don't need a manual.
If you haven't tried it out yet,
[sign up for a trial](/accounts/signup/)
to give it a shot!
Sometimes,
though,
we want to learn things
that playing with the app can't teach well.
That's where the documentation fits in.

The documentation aims to provide rich context
that you may want
when considering if School Desk is right for you.

* How does School Desk compare to other online homeschool planners?
* What are the Frequently Asked Questions that other users ask?
* How can I understand how the app works and what terminology School Desk uses?

These are the kinds of questions
that the documentation tries to answer.
Please let me know
if there are other areas
that you think the documentation should cover
to help you have a better experience using the tool.

Happy reading!
