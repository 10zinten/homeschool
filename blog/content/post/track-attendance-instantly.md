Keeping records is a fact of life
for most homeschooling families.
While you should still check what's required
by your local government
for your family,
School Desk wants to help where we can.
To that end,
we're excited to announce the availability
of an attendance report
that automatically tracks your student's attendance.

<!--more-->

For those of you in states that require attendance tracking,
we've got you covered.
School Desk has attendance reports
for each of your students
in a school year.
The best part?
You don't have to do anything!

Here's how it works:

* If your student completed any tasks
    on a school day,
    then they are counted as attending
    that day of school.
* All your scheduled school breaks appear on the report
    to show when your student has the day off.
* Any days that aren't part
    of your school year (typically, the weekend) appear
    for completeness
    and show that no school is running those days.

We think this report takes all the tedium out
of attendance tracking
and hope you enjoy it!
Check it out in the reports section.
