School Desk is great
for showing what your students need to do
for the week,
but what about what *you* need to do?
You now have access
to a teacher checklist
to help you track tasks
for the week.

<!--more-->

In time for your new school year,
School Desk includes printable checklists for teachers.
From the week page,
you'll see a new button
for "Teacher Checklist"
that will take you to a new page.
This new page shows a list view
of all of your students' activities
for the week.
You can print this page
to record any special notes
for yourself.

If you don't want to see all the courses
on the checklist,
then click the "Edit" pencil icon
by the title.
On this edit page,
you can exclude courses
from the checklist
by unchecking the courses
that you want to hide.

School Desk features are added slowly and deliberately.
I strive to keep this service simple and manageable
for families.
If you enjoy this simplicity,
would you share School Desk with your homeschooling friends (or family)?
No one is a better advocate than a happy user,
and I'd love for School Desk to reach more homeschooling families
like yours.

Thanks to Amie for this feature suggestion!
If you have feature suggestions yourself,
