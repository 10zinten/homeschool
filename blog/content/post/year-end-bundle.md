At long last,
I have finished the year-end PDF bundle.
This new feature brings all of your school year activities
into a single package.
The bundle includes PDF reports
of all the tasks
that each of your students did
in a school year
and a lot more!

In the bundle,
you'll get PDF reports
of all the reports
that are currently available
to you on the Reports page.
This includes

* The attendance report for each student
* The progress report for each student
* A list of resources for each student
* A list of completed tasks for each student

My hope is the bundle makes finishing out your year a joy.
No more wasted time collecting all the evidence you need
to show your local goverment
that you taught your students.
All of that is pulled together for you
into a convenient zip file.

You can find this new feature of your Reports page. Enjoy!
