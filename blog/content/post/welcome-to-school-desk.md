Hello!
I want to welcome you to School Desk,
a new homeschool planner
to help homeschooling teachers
with their schools.

At the end of 2019,
my wife hit a rough patch
with the homeschool planner
that she was using.
The planner had a clunky user interface
and the website wasn't secure!

As a software engineer specializing
in web application development,
I thought I could do better.

School Desk began as a side project
with my spouse as the first customer
and product designer.
