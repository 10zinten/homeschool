Hello!
I want to welcome you to School Desk,
a new homeschool planner
to help homeschooling teachers
with their schools.

At the end of 2019,
my wife hit a rough patch
with the homeschool planner
that she was using.
The planner had a clunky user interface,
the website wasn't secure,
and the site would go down
for hours at a time
when she wanted to use it!

As a software engineer specializing
in web application development,
I thought I could do better.

School Desk began as a side project
with my spouse as the first customer
and product designer.
We worked together
to determine the elements
that she needed
to make a solid school planner.

From our discussions,
I heard her goals clearly:

1. The app must be simple to use.
2. The app needs to build a schedule automatically.

With her continual feedback,
I built up the application bit by bit.
We designed the app
to use concepts
that are familiar
to any school:
grade levels, courses, students, grades, and so on.

The net result is an app
that I believe is tailor-made
for homeschooling families.

If you're looking for a homeschool planner,
give School Desk a try.
I think you'll be happy you did.
