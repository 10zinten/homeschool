What Can School Desk Do for Me?
===============================

As a homeschool planner,
School Desk focuses
on tasks
that help you manage your school year.
On this help page,
you'll learn about some of the things
that the service can do for you.

School Schedules
----------------

How do you keep track
of all the tasks
that your students
need to complete each day?
You can let School Desk aid you
with managing your schedule.

School Desk works by fitting your students' tasks
into the course dates
that you choose
for each course in a school year.

What does that look like?

* You tell School Desk what tasks students need to complete
  for a course.
* You let School Desk know what days of the week you want your courses
  to run.
* School Desk takes all of those tasks
  and the desired school days
  and builds a schedule
  that is tailored for each
  of your students.
* As your students complete work,
  the automated schedule adapts
  to tasks that you mark as complete.

Let's say you want your student
to do piano lessons every Tuesday and Friday.
You could create the tasks
in a "Music" course.
The tasks could detail what you want to happen each lesson
(or not!
If you're more free form,
details aren't required!).

Once you set the "Music" course
to run on Tuesday and Friday,
School Desk will automatically project every day
that your student should do lessons
for the year.

With this automated scheduling approach,
you can see your entire school year planned out
if that's your style.
You could also add tasks each day or week
if you don't like to be a long term planner.
Whatever your approach,
School Desk is flexible for you.

*What happens if your student doesn't finish a task
on a given day?*
School Desk will seamlessly move that task
to the scheduled day
for that course.

Reports
-------

Most homeschooling families have reporting obligations
to show their local government
that their homeschool complies
with local laws.

School Desk provides these common reports.
No report building is necessary.
The reports are created automatically
and designed to be printable directly
from your browser
to create a paper copy
or save to the PDF format.

Progress Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Progress Report shows a student's grades
for a school year.
All the grades are grouped by course,
and each course displays the student's average.

Attendance Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Attendance Report tracks your student's attendance
in a school year.
Here's how it works:

* If your student completed any tasks
  on a school day,
  then they are counted as attending
  that day of school.
* All your scheduled school breaks are on the report
  to show when your student has the day off.
* Any days that aren't part
  of your school year (typically, the weekend) appear
  for completeness
  and show that no school is running those days.

Resource Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each course that your student is in can have associated resources
like textbooks,
novels,
workbooks,
and any other class material.
The Resource Report shows all of those resources
for a single school year,
grouped by course,
on a single page.

Quick Task Creation
-------------------

Part of building a school schedule is creating the tasks
for each of your students.
School Desk provides handy options
to remove extra steps
when building your tasks.

* **Create in bulk**:
  School Desk includes a task creation form
  that will grow automatically as you need
  to enter more tasks
  for your course.
  You can stay focused on your course preparation
  instead of fiddling with website forms.
* **Task replication**:
  "Practice, practice, practice!"
  If your students have tasks
  that happen repeatedly
  like music practice,
  you can create all of those tasks
  in one swoop.
* **Automatically number tasks**:
  Maybe you want to replicate tasks
  *and* assign each one a number
  like "Lesson 1," "Lesson 2,"
  and so on.
  School Desk's task creation tools also make this trivial
  to add
  to a course.
