Homeschool Minder
=================

`Homeschool Minder <https://www.homeschoolminder.com/>`_
is an online homeschool planner,
started in 2012,
that wants to help a user "be a better teacher."
Homeschool Minder is a subscription service
that costs $39.99 per year or $4.99 per month
(with a 30 day free trial). [#f1]_

The service includes a robust calendar feature
to show events and activities.
A user of Homeschool Minder
registers students
with individual courses
for a school year.
These courses are applied
to different terms
in the school year.

To add work,
users create instructional plans and assignments
for lesson plans
that are part of a course.
These lesson plans are scheduled
into the school year
with some advanced calendar options
to set recurrence
and when the instructional plans should occur.

In addition to lesson plans,
Homeschool Minder users can track student skills
and map activities to standards and goals.
This mode in the service lets users monitor other growth goals
of students that exist outside
of classroom contexts.

Beyond the scheduling capabilities,
Homeschool Minder has a gradebook
to view and manage student assessments.
The grading tools in the service support custom weighting
and scales.

Compare to School Desk
----------------------

Homeschool Minder and School Desk both want
to help you plan your homeschool year,
but with very different strategies.

With Homeschool Minder,
users have a huge array of options.
Homeschool Minder has a variety
of different event types
(including custom event types)
and activities.
The service includes many different methods
of tracking student work
and is extremely granular
in that tracking.
For the ultra detailed user
who wants to have complete control,
Homeschool Minder may be an excellent fit.

**School Desk aims for simplicity first and foremost.**
Because of the focus on simplicity,
School Desk offers fewer ways
to track and manage activity.
This simplified flow provides you
with the core tools you need
to run a homeschool
without extra features
that may be overkill
for your school year.
School Desk is ideal
for a homeschool family
that wants to plan
without the burden
of extra management.

Both School Desk and Homeschool Minder include:

* Unlimited students
* Scheduling tools to see the school activities of your students
* Reports to show progress, attendance, and more

Aside from all the extra tools and layers
that Homeschool Minder offers,
School Desk and Homeschool Minder differ substantially
in how the schedule is created.

* With Homeschool Minder,
  the lesson plans and their set dates
  and calendar rules determine what appears
  on the schedule.
* With School Desk,
  you create a list of tasks
  in your desired order,
  and School Desk will generate the week schedule
  for you automatically
  based on the days you pick
  for your courses to run.

The design of School Desk lends itself
to families that want a great tool
to manage their school year
and no confusing fluff.
If that sounds like you,
then **check out School Desk!**
