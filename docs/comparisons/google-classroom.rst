Google Classroom
================

`Google Classroom <https://edu.google.com/products/classroom/>`_
is a service provided by Google
to help teachers manage students
in a classroom setting.
The service is available to individual educators
for free.

While usable for homeschooling families,
Google Classroom is designed
for teachers
who work in a traditional classroom setting.
Teachers, students, and parents/guardians interact
with each other
via separate accounts.

Teachers have the ability
to create a variety of materials
for students, including:
assignments,
quizzes,
questions,
and class studying material.
Each type of content can be delivered
to students immediately
or scheduled
for a future date.

Google Classroom teachers can grade assignments
and define detailed rubrics
to describe how students will be graded.

Because Google Classroom is for the traditional classroom setting,
the service lacks tools
for managing a student's full academic record.
Most classroom teachers will not have the same students year after year,
so it's unsurprising that Google Classroom
does not provide a multi-year perspective
of individual students.

Compare to School Desk
----------------------

School Desk is designed
with homeschool families in mind.
Homeschool educators instruct their children each year,
so School Desk records each student's academic record
and keeps student history.
The history is used
for reports
that help homeschool families comply
with governmental reporting requirements.

Google Classroom expects all content
to be scheduled individually.
School Desk's automatic schedule building handles the dates
for you.
School Desk educators can focus
on the content
of their classes
and let School Desk handle the scheduling.

Since homeschool educators handle *all* classes
for their students,
School Desk's user interface provides quick access
to all the different courses and subjects
that educators teach.
This holisitic approach brings the focus down
to the smaller number of students
that homeschool families have.
Google Classroom scales better
for larger classes
that are typical
to US schools
(24 - 26 students [#f1]_),
but most homeschool families don't need that level of scale.

Google Classroom includes tools
that are good for large classrooms,
but offer little benefit
to the average homeschooling family.
The communication tools like announcements, private chat, and discussion boards
are unlikely to be effective
when your student lives under your roof.

We think Google Classroom is an excellent tool
that helps educators
who deal with the challenges
of large classes.
If you're looking for a tool
that offers a more personalized experience
and is designed for families,
then **check out School Desk!**
