CM Organizer
============

`CM Organizer <https://simplycharlottemason.com/store/cm-organizer/>`_
is a homeschool planner
that focuses heavily
on families using the Charlotte Mason method
of education.

CM organizer is $7.95 per month
and has a basic account
that is free. [#f1]_
The free account lets users experience most of the app
and is a good way to check out the service.
The limited number of resources
that can be added
on the free tier prevents users
from using the free level forever.

Because CM Organizer is an app
for the Charlotte Mason method,
the service is primarily
about adding books
to your schedule
to craft your school year.

The app refers to books as "resources"
and drives user interaction
through these resources.
Users add resources
by searching via ISBN
for a pre-existing resource
on the service
or creating their own.
Each resource is split
on the scheduler
with divisions
(which are a natural fit
when assigning chapters
to students)
to determine how much work
to complete per day.

CM Organizer includes some features
that are only available
with a subscription:

1. The ability to add an unlimited number of resources
2. Sharing resources with others
   that are using the service
3. Certain types of reports

Compare to School Desk
----------------------

The most pronounced difference
between CM Organizer and School Desk
is the pedagogical focus.
CM Organizer is designed
for families using the Charlotte Mason method
while School Desk is a more general purpose planner.

While CM Organizer puts resources
on the school schedule
for a student
with activities managed by "divisions"
of a resource,
School Desk adds tasks
to courses
to drive the schedule.

Practically,
CM Organizer's pre-existing resources provide more rapid schedule building
at the cost of flexibility.
School Desk tasks do not have to be tied
to a book or resource.

Both apps include:

* Unlimited students
* Automatic schedule building with weekly and daily views
* Reports like progress reports

CM Organizer excels
with showing books
to parents to prepare a schedule.
The resource-centric model is excellent
for parents looking
to feed books to the tool's scheduler
for their students.
CM Organizer additionally benefits
from the Simply Charlotte Mason community
that backs the tool.

School Desk shines
with its ability to schedule any kind of work,
show the future schedule for days, weeks, and months ahead,
and manage vacations and breaks.
School Desk also includes grading and assignment features
that are absent from CM Organizer.

If you're using the Charlotte Mason method,
then CM Organizer may be the best tool for you.
If you're looking for a tool
that goes beyond the books,
then **check out School Desk!**
