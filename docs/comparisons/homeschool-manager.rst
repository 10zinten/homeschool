Homeschool Manager
==================

`Homeschool Manager <https://homeschoolmanager.com/>`_
is a homeschool planner aimed at families.
The service states that it is
for "Type-A Moms,"
"Short-term Planners,"
"Adapting Planners,"
and "Purposefully Spontaneous Planners." [#f1]_
Homeschool Manager is a subscription service
that costs $49 per year or $5.99 per month
(with a 30 day free trial). [#f2]_

As a homeschool planner,
Homeschool Manager's headline feature is its scheduling tool.
The product lets users build a schedule
for each student in the family.
Within the tool,
the user views each student's schedule
in a weekly view
that presents all of the student's tasks, assignments, quizzes, and tests.
All of these activities are grouped by a school subject.

Aside from the primary feature,
Homeschool Manager includes a number of secondary features
that are important for managing a homeschool.

* Users can generate a variety
  of reports
  like report cards,
  transcripts,
  and other documents
  that homeschool families often require.
* The service gives users a central dashboard view
  to see how the school year is going for all their students
  at once.
  This dashboard shows overdue tasks and items
  that need grades.

Compare to School Desk
----------------------

Homeschool Manager primarily differs from School Desk
in its method
of building and presenting the schedule.

* With Homeschool Manager,
  the schedule will display the school week
  and the user will fill in tasks directly
  for each day.
* With School Desk,
  you create a list of tasks
  in your desired order,
  and School Desk will generate the week schedule
  for you automatically
  based on the days you pick
  for your courses to run.

Both services provide reports
for important homeschool tracking
like progress reports
and attendance tracking.

With either service,
you can have an unlimited number
of students,
school years,
and anything else
that you need to track
for your homeschool.

Homeschool Manager includes some unique features.
If a student needs to track volunteer hours,
Homeschool Manager comes
with an ability to track those hours
for the student.
Additionally,
the service has a dashboard
to allow users to manage overdue tasks
and work to grade.
With the service's model of setting explicit dates,
the dashboard is a mechanism
to handle those tasks
that are set for the past.

In contrast, with School Desk's automatic schedule building,
any incomplete tasks are automatically rolled forward
to a future date.

The two services also handle showing multiple schedules differently.
Homeschool Manager shows the weekly schedule
for one student at a time.
School Desk will show you the schedule
for all of your students
on a single page.

Ultimately,
either service can help you manage your homeschool schedule.
With a similar set of features,
picking between Homeschool Manager and School Desk may come
to your preference
in how you want to manage your schedule.

If you want very specific control
on which exact days you want your students,
Homeschool Manager might be a good fit for you.

On the other hand,
if you are more focused on the sequence
of tasks to complete
and you want a service
that will build your schedule automatically,
then **check out School Desk!**
