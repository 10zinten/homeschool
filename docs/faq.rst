What Does "Automatic Schedule Building" Mean?
---------------------------------------------

When we say that School Desk builds your schedule *automatically*,
we should clarify.
As much as it would be amazing
for a tool to understand
your homeschool
and comletely build a course curriculum
for you,
that's not really feasible.

What School Desk *can* do is determine
all the appropriate dates
for your school work
after you provide some information.

What does that look like?

* You tell School Desk what tasks students need to complete
  for a course.
* You let School Desk know what days of the week you want your courses
  to run.
* School Desk takes all of those tasks
  and the desired school days
  and builds a schedule
  that is tailored for each
  of your students.
* As your students complete work,
  the automated schedule adapts
  to tasks that you mark as complete.

With this approach,
you can use the daily or weekly views
of your homeschool's tasks
to know what your students need to work on each day.
