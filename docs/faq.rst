What Does "Automatic Schedule Building" Mean?
---------------------------------------------

When we say that School Desk builds your schedule *automatically*,
we should clarify.
As much as it would be amazing
for a tool to understand
your homeschool
and completely build a course curriculum
for you,
that's not really feasible.

What School Desk *can* do is determine
all the appropriate dates
for your school work
after you provide some information.

What does that look like?

* You tell School Desk what tasks students need to complete
  for a course.
* You let School Desk know what days of the week you want your courses
  to run.
* School Desk takes all of those tasks
  and the desired school days
  and builds a schedule
  that is tailored for each
  of your students.
* As your students complete work,
  the automated schedule adapts
  to tasks that you mark as complete.

With this approach,
you can use the daily or weekly views
of your homeschool's tasks
to know what your students need to work on each day.

What Happens When I Fall Behind In Tracking Tasks?
--------------------------------------------------

Any tasks that your students do not complete
in a week
will push to the next week automatically.
But there will be times where your students did the work,
and you didn't get a chance to get into School Desk
and mark the tasks as complete.
If tasks automatically roll forward,
how do you go back and set things as completed
in the past?

School Desk has two ways to set tasks
as completed in the past:

1. The daily view can fill
   in past activity.
   When you look at a past date in the app,
   School Desk will try to fill in the next available task
   for each course
   if no task is marked as complete
   for that date.
   This gives you the ability to go back in time
   and walk through each day where you did not set any tasks as complete.
2. You can also set a task
   by visiting the student's course page
   that tracks their progress
   (this page is accessible
   by clicking a course name
   on the weekly or daily view).
   From this list of tasks,
   select the calendar icon
   for the task that you want to set.
   On the following page, you can set the date
   when your student completed the task.
