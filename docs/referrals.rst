Refer a Friend
==============

If you are using School Desk
and would like to refer a friend
to try out the service,
you can do that from the app.
From your Settings page,
you can add an email address,
and we'll send a welcoming message
within one day
with an invitation
to your friend.

As a way to thank you
for referring a friend,
if your friend signs up
with School Desk
using that email address
and becomes a paying member,
**we'll add two months
of School Desk service
to your account
for free!**

We know that School Desk users are our best advocates,
and this is a small way
that we can thank you
for sharing School Desk
with your community.
