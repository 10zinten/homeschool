Terminology
===========

School Desk uses a handful of terms
to structure your school.
The most critical terminology is listed below.

.. glossary::

    School Year
        All School Desk schedules exist in a school year.
        You get to define the start and stop
        of your school year.
        Whether you choose to run a more traditional school year
        with a summer off
        or run a school year all year long,
        School Desk gives you that control.

    Grade Level
        Each student is part of a single grade level
        in a school year.
        All courses are assigned to the grade level.
        If you have students that are learning
        at the same level,
        all material is updated once
        for the grade level
        instead of copying for each student.

    Course
        A grade level is made up of courses.
        Courses are whatever you want them to be.
        You may have courses like "Math" and "Literature."
        School Desk doesn't limit the kinds of courses you can create.
        Need "Cooking," "Keyboarding," or "Dance?"
        No problem.

        Also, courses *can be shared across grade levels*.
        Do you have similarly aged students
        in different grades but sharing a subject
        like "Art?"
        School Desk handles that too.

    Task
        A task is the item that appears each day
        on your schedule
        for whatever courses run on that day.
        A task can be graded, or not.

    Student
        The student is the star of the show.
        Each of your students is enrolled
        in a grade level.
        The student has a schedule that is tailored to them
        and tracks individual progress.

    Resource
        Any materials related to a course are called resources.
        Resources are your textbooks,
        workbooks,
        multimedia,
        or any other content
        that you wish to track
        with a course's history.
