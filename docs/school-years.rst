School Years
============

All School Desk schedules exist in a :term:`School Year`.
School years contain grade levels
that your students will be enrolled in.

Breaks
------

Since schedules are generated automatically
by School Desk,
the scheduling system needs to be aware
of any holidays or breaks
in your school year
to sequence tasks
on the right days.

You can add School Breaks
to your school year
to highlight the days
that your students will not be doing school officially.

School breaks can apply
to all students enrolled
in a school year
or to a subset
of enrolled students.
This added flexibility makes your schedule more accurate,
especially if you have many students
in your family
to keep track of.
