    <p class="mb-2">
      Hello!
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      Iâ€™m Matt Layman, the founder of School Desk.
      I created School Desk
      to provide an online tool
      that my wife could use
      to help manage how she homeschools our kids.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      With my 10+ years
      of professional software development experience
      and her knowledge as an educator,
      we built School Desk
      to fit the needs
      of homeschooling families
      like our own.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      We value simplicity.
      The features in School Desk
      make it possible to run your school at home
      without a bunch of extra fluff.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      If you decide to try School Desk
      for your family,
      I hope that it serves you
      as well as it serves my family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regards,<br>
      Matt
    </p>
