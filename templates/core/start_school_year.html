      <p class="mb-4">
        I know from my own home life that managing a child's school schedule is a lot of work.
        I've worked with my wife who homeschools our children to develop this application.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        This application is the system that we use to keep our school life sane.
        I'm glad I can share it, and I hope the app can bring some sanity to you as well.
      </p>
